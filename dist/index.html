          <h4>Personal model</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            I believe it is important to implement blended teaching that match the best techniques with the
            appropriate
            learning scenarios and students in an adaptive format. The two methods I personally use is the
            demonstrator and facilitator method.
            The demonstrator retains the formal authority role by showing students what they need to know.
            The demonstrator is a lot like the lecturer, but their lessons include multimedia presentations,
            activities, and demonstrations. Facilitators promote self-learning and help students develop
            critical thinking skills and retain
            knowledge that leads to self-actualization.

          <h4>Teaching Philosophy</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            I believe that every students is unique and that now one learns the same. It is therefore
            neccesary to create an environment where students can grow emotionally, mentally, socialy and
            physically. Students must be encouraged to take risks and be comfortable sharing their thoughts.
            Teaching is a life-long learning process and regardless of one's experience there is always room
            for improvement. Therefore I believe it is important to be open to changes and adapting
            different teaching methods and always improving. I lead by example and always make sure that my
            students is interested in my subject.
